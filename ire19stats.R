# Linear regresion analysis
lm.out <- lm(Diamond$price~Diamond$carat)
summary(lm.out)

# Interpret the results
# - For every one-carat increase in the diamond, its value increases $11,599.
# - This model is statistically significant at the 99.9% confidence level (p value < 0.001).
# - There is a statistically significant relationship between the number of number of carats and price of a diamond.
# - The adjusted R-squared is 0.89, meaning 89% of the variation in price is explained by carat.

### Regression analysis

# Bivariate regression: Test scores and student-teacher ratio
Model1 <-lm(MCAS$totsc4~MCAS$tchratio)
summary(Model1)

#Interpret the results
# - A one-unit increase in the student-teacher ratio in this model decreases the average test score by 1.7 points.
# - The relationship between student-teacher ratio and test scores is statistically significant at the 99.9% confidence level.
# - However, this model only explains 7 percent of the variation in test scores.

# Multiple linear regression: Test scores and student-teacher ratio+spending per pupil
Model2 <-lm(MCAS$totsc4~MCAS$tchratio+MCAS$regday)
summary(Model2)

#Interpret the results
# -This model is also statistically significant, but still only explains about 6 percent of the variation in test scores.

# Multiple linear regression: Test scores and student-teacher ratio+spending per pupil+percent of students receiving free lunch
Model3 <-lm(MCAS$totsc4~MCAS$tchratio+MCAS$percap+MCAS$lnchpct)
summary(Model3)

# Interpret the results
# -There is a statistically significant relationship between all variables included in this model and test scores.
# -Model 3 is a much better fit than Models 1 and 2. This model explains 67 percent of the variation in test scores.
# -In this model, a one-unit increase in student-teacher ratio decreases the average test score by 0.7 points after controlling per-capita income and students eligible for free/reduced lunch.

### Regression analysis 

# Linear regression: Test scores and student-teacher ratio
Model4 <-lm(Caschool$testscr~Caschool$str)
summary(Model4)

# Interpret the results
# -There is a statistically significant relationship between student-teacher ratio and test scores.
# -However, this model only explains roughly 5 percent of the variation in test scores.
# -A one-unit increase in the student-teacher ratio in this model decreases the average test score by 2.3 points.

# Multiple regression: Test scores and student-teacher ratio + computers-per-student
Model5 <-lm(Caschool$testscr~Caschool$str+Caschool$compstu)
summary(Model5)

# Interpret the results
# -This model is less statistically significant, and still only explains about 9 percent of the variation in test scores.
# -After controlling for computers-per-student, in this model a one-unit increase in student-teacher-ratio equals a 0.2 point decrease in test scores.

# Multiple regression analysis: Test scores and student-teacher ratio + computers-per-student + average income
Model6 <- lm(Caschool$testscr~Caschool$str+Caschool$compstu+Caschool$avginc)
summary(Model6)

# Interpret the results
# -After controlling for both computers-per-student and average income, student-teacher ratio is no longer staistically significat at th 95 percent confidence level.
# -This does not mean there isnâ€™t a real-world relationship between student-teacher ratio and student test scores.
# -Importantly, note that this model still only accounts for 52% of the variation in student test scores. There must be omitted variables.
# -This analysis shows there is need for further inquiry. We do some reporting and analysis to find what other omitted variables need to be factored into the analysis.

# Analysis 4: NFL TV Ratings and politics#

### Sidenote on social science methods: Hypothesis testing###


# "Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!"
# - President Donald Trump, 9/26/2017: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912624892239077376

# Null hypothesis: There is no stastically significant relationship between political support for President Trump and NFL ratings.
#
# Alternative hypothesis: There is a statistically significant relationship between political support for President Trump and NFL ratings.

### Linear regresion analysis: NFL ratings change vs. Trump voting percentage
lm.out <- lm(NFL.ratings$ratings.change~NFL.ratings$trump.percent)
summary(lm.out)

# Interpret the results
# - A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of a TV market which voted for President Trump is associated with a change of 6-unit decrease in the Sunday Night Football rating
# - However, the relationship between votes for Trump and is not statistically significant at the 95% percent confidence level, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
# -In this model, political support for President Trump explains only 8 percent of variation in Sunday Night Football TV rating changes.
